# LinkedIn Helper

A basic Chrome extension that improves the search experience for jobs on LinkedIn.

When on the LinkedIn Job Search page (with all the header filters), all job cards that are either Viewed or Saved are hidden upon trigger (current trigger is just pressing the "h" key on your keyboard).

This was made in less than a day and is my first Chrome extension, so apologies if it's janky. Feel free to fork and add improvements!

Potential future updates:
- trigger hide when loading the page
- trigger hide when scrolling and more jobs appear
- trigger hide when clicking away from a job, maybe?

- save links to viewed jobs; allow that to be viewable

- add an option within hello.html to turn off the plugin and/or re-show hidden job cards

- allow hide based on Viewed, Applied, or Promoted
- hide by either removing entirely (style="display:none"), or by displaying a blank card instead, or by adding a grey overlay to the card
